# EmployeeCSVGroup

Group project by Adelaide Baron as Scrum Master, Vani Sampath, and Lee Halperin. 

This project imports a CSV file of corrupted employee info, cleans (pre-empted) corruptions and rellocates corrupted data to a seperate CSV. Clean data is then imported to a PostgreSQL database. 

Reassurance logs output to the console, and the user selects the level of logging they wish to see at the beginning. 

## ðŸ›  WIP

- Incorporate threading 
- Optimise processing speed 
- Refactor 
- Clear CSV and log file automatically.
